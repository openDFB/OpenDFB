Support rotated screens (180 is implemented).

Move config system to libdirect with more features and much smaller/generic code.

Write well documented driver skeletons.

Finish implementation of cooperative levels.

Finish module unloading (done for most cases).

Convert all D_DEBUG usage to D_DEBUG_AT using some D_DEBUG_DOMAINs.
Implement debug levels, one setting per domain.

Modularize pixel formats (eventually with dynamic extension support).
